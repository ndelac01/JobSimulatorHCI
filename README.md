# Original Idea of the project

This project is made in AR. The original idea was the combination of MR(Mix Reality) with Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, connected to the Oculus Quest 2. During the simulation the user has a job as a surgeon in practice. During their practice they have to go through a set of instruction and practice to complete their task. During the procedure and accomplishment of the following task. The user is being graded based on their performance with this we can evaluate how well they do in their training. Feeling comfortable in the field and understanding of the procedure being taken into action. An example of the this is shown in the follow figures below:
